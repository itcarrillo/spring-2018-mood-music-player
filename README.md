Smoodify
========
A music playing application that shuffles songs according to the mood determined by the lyrics or melody of the songs the user listens to.


Motivation
==========
*Fill in the specifics on how this application was initially thought up.*

The primary motivation for creating this application was to provide an easier way for music listeners to attain songs that relate to their current moods. Sometimes when we listen to music, even if we have a playlist set up, we are unhappy with a particular song that plays and it unwillingly changes the mood. We want to avoid this kind of let down and give users a smooth mood-satisfying musical experience.
